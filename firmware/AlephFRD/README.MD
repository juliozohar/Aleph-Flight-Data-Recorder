Welcome to the Aleph Flight Data Recorder Project!

This is the main firmware for the circuit, so far. We know there is a lot it can
be better. So we invite you to fork this project and send your pull requests
with your optimizations. We will be very grateful to have you as one of the
project's collaborators.

Be welcome!
