Lessons learned

Over this iteraction, we have learned some important lessons:

Design

- Reorient all the components, so the positive polarity is placed in a standard
pattern. Do so to the IC's #1 pins. This gives a practical sense of orientation
through the design, and makes the assembly easier.

- The battery holder takes a great amount of space in the board's total area, thus
enlarging the ensemble and making it more expensive in the end. Look for another
type of battery, smaller than CR2025. As a suggestion, we could have the following
battery series: 1216, 1220, 1225.

- The interface connection between the board and the exterior is not stable, with
various wires connected in a 1:1 basis. Rethink this design to incorporate some
"smarter" interface, like molex connectors, at least from the PCB's side.


Board production:

- The silkscreen layer was blown out. The factory's instructions weren't as accurate
as we would like them to be. For the next iterations, make sure the silkscreen layer
stands in good format for production.

- The battery holder's legs were thicker than the holes drilled in the board. Although
this is not strictly a factory problem, this decreases the product's overall quality.
Look for another battery holder blueprint to ensure the correct fabrication.
